# Simpsons Methods Algorithms

## What the Algorithm is:
This algorithm evaluates an integral of the given data using the Simpson's 1/3 rule. If there is an extra interval, the trapezoidal rule will be used on the last interval. 

## Inputs
x = equally spaced independed variables 
y = function values vector 

## Outputs
I = numerical integral calculated

## Limitations 
Only uses the Simpson's 1/3rd rule and ocassionally the trapezoidal rule.
There will be some error associated with the value and it will not be exact. 

## Notes:
In future, should do a similar algorithm for the Simpson's 3/8th rule.
