# Machine Epsilon Algorithms

## What Algorithm is:
This Algorithm calculates the Machine Epsilon of the computer by consecutively halving the value until the outcome value is less than or equal to one.

## Inputs:
Start by setting a variable equal to 1.

## Outputs:
Displays the machine epsilon of the computuer to the user.

## Limitations:
Limitations Unknown

## Notes: 
n/a
