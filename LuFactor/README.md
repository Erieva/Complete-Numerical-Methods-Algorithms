# LU Factoring Algorithm

## What the Alogirthm is:
This algorithm conducts an LU decomposition with pivoting.

## Inputs:
A = coefficient matrix

## Outputs:
L= lower triangular matrix
U= upper triangular matrix
P = permutation matrix

## Limitations:
This will not work if the coefficient matrix is ill-conditioned. 
Only uses partial pivoting. 

## Notes:
